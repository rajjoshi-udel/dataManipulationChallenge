## 🎯 Note on Python Usage

**Recommended Workflow: Use Your Existing Virtual Environment**
If you completed the Tech Setup Challenge Part 2, you already have a virtual environment set up! Here's how to use it for this new challenge:

1. **Clone this new challenge repository** (see Getting Started section below)
2. **Open the cloned repository in Cursor**
3. **Set this project to use your existing Python interpreter:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Navigate to and choose the interpreter from your existing virtual environment (e.g., `your-previous-project/venv/Scripts/python.exe`)
4. **Activate the environment in your terminal:**
   - Open terminal in Cursor (`Ctrl + ``)
   - Navigate to your previous project folder where you have the `venv` folder
   - **💡 Pro tip:** You can quickly navigate by typing `cd` followed by dragging the folder from your file explorer into the terminal
   - Activate using the appropriate command for your system:
     - **Windows Command Prompt:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - **Windows PowerShell:** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
     - **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
   - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt
5. **Install additional packages if needed:** `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Cloud Storage Warning

**Avoid using Google Drive, OneDrive, or other cloud storage for Python projects!** These services can cause issues with:
- Package installations failing due to file locking
- Virtual environment corruption
- Slow performance during pip operations

**Best practice:** Keep your Python projects in a local folder like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\` or `~/Documents/` instead of cloud-synced folders.
:::

**Alternative: Create a New Virtual Environment**
If you prefer a fresh environment, follow the Quarto documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html). Be sure to follow the instructions to activate the environment, set it up as your default Python interpreter for the project, and install the necessary packages (e.g. pandas) for this challenge.  For installing the packages, you can use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command since you already have the requirements.txt file in your project.   Some steps do take a bit of time, so be patient.

**Why This Works:** Virtual environments are portable - you can use the same environment across multiple projects, and Cursor automatically activates it when you select the interpreter!

## The Problem: Mastering Data Manipulation Through Method Chaining

**Core Question:** How can we efficiently manipulate datasets using `pandas` method chaining to answer complex business questions?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data analysis requires combining multiple data manipulation techniques in sequence. Rather than creating intermediate variables at each step, method chaining allows us to write clean, readable code that flows logically from one operation to the next.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with ZappTech's shipment data to answer critical business questions about service levels and cross-category orders, using the seven mental models of data manipulation through pandas method chaining.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Seven Mental Models of Data Manipulation

The seven most important ways we manipulate datasets are:

1. **Assign:** Add new variables with calculations and transformations
2. **Subset:** Filter data based on conditions or select specific columns
3. **Drop:** Remove unwanted variables or observations
4. **Sort:** Arrange data by values or indices
5. **Aggregate:** Summarize data using functions like mean, sum, count
6. **Merge:** Combine information from multiple datasets
7. **Split-Apply-Combine:** Group data and apply functions within groups


## Data and Business Context

We analyze ZappTech's shipment data, which contains information about product deliveries across multiple categories. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Questions:** CEO wants to understand service levels and cross-category shopping patterns
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Requires merging shipment data with product category information
- **Complex Relationships:** Service levels may vary by product category, and customers may order across categories
- **Method Chaining Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all seven mental models in sequence

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the ZappTech shipment data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load the shipment data
shipments_df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyaflya/persuasive/main/shipments.csv", 
    parse_dates=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate']
)

# Load product line data
product_line_df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyaflya/persuasive/main/productLine.csv"
)

# Reduce dataset size for faster processing (4,000 rows instead of 96,805 rows)
shipments_df = shipments_df.head(4000)

print("Shipments data shape:", shipments_df.shape)
print("\nShipments data columns:", shipments_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of shipments data:")
print(shipments_df.head(10))

print("\n" + "="*50)
print("Product line data shape:", product_line_df.shape)
print("\nProduct line data columns:", product_line_df.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of product line data:")
print(product_line_df.head(10))
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Understanding the Data

**Shipments Data:** Contains individual line items for each shipment, including:
- `shipID`: Unique identifier for each shipment
- `partID`: Product identifier
- `plannedShipDate`: When the shipment was supposed to go out
- `actualShipDate`: When it actually shipped
- `quantity`: How many units were shipped

**Product Category and Line Data:** Contains product category information:
- `partID`: Links to shipments data
- `productLine`: The category each product belongs to
- `prodCategory`: The category each product belongs to

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Does service level (on-time shipments) vary across product categories?
2. How often do orders include products from more than one category?
:::

## The Seven Mental Models: A Progressive Learning Journey

Now we'll work through each of the seven mental models using method chaining, starting simple and building complexity.

### 1. Assign: Adding New Variables

**Mental Model:** Create new columns with calculations and transformations.

Let's start by calculating whether each shipment was late:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-1-assign
#| echo: true

# Simple assignment - calculate if shipment was late
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days
    )
)

print("Added lateness calculations:")
print(shipments_with_lateness[['shipID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'is_late', 'days_late']].head())
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Method Chaining Tip for New Python Users

**Why use `lambda df:`?** When chaining methods, we need to reference the current state of the dataframe. The `lambda df:` tells pandas "use the current dataframe in this calculation." Without it, pandas would look for a variable called `df` that doesn't exist.

**Alternative approach:** You could also write this as separate steps, but method chaining keeps related operations together and makes the code more readable.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Assign Mental Model

**Question 1: Data Types and Date Handling**
- What is the `dtype` of the `actualShipDate` series? How can you find out using code?
- Why is it important that both `actualShipDate` and `plannedShipDate` have the same data type for comparison?

**Question 2: String vs Date Comparison**
- Can you give an example where comparing two dates as strings would yield unintuitive results, e.g. what happens if you try to compare "04-11-2025" and "05-20-2024" as strings vs as dates?

**Question 3: Debug This Code**
```python
# This code has an error - can you spot it?
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
        lateStatement="Darn Shipment is Late" if shipments_df['is_late'] else "Shipment is on Time"
    )
)
```
What's wrong with the `lateStatement` assignment and how would you fix it?
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

** Answer to Question 1: Data Types and Date Handling**
```{python}
# Check the dtype of actualShipDate
print(shipments_df['actualShipDate'].dtype)
# Output: datetime64[ns]

# You can also check it using the .dtypes attribute on the dataframe
print(shipments_df.dtypes['actualShipDate'])
```

** Answer to Question 2: String vs Date Comparison**
```{python}
# Example where comparing two dates as strings would yield unintuitive results
print("04-11-2025" > "05-20-2024")  # This would return True because "04-11-2025" is later than "05-20-2024"

# If you convert them to dates first, the comparison works correctly
print(pd.to_datetime("04-11-2025") > pd.to_datetime("05-20-2024"))  # This returns False
```

** Answer to Question 3: Debug This Code**
```{python}
# This code has an error - can you spot it?
shipments_with_lateness = (
    shipments_df
    .assign(
        is_late=lambda df: df['actualShipDate'] > df['plannedShipDate'],
        days_late=lambda df: (df['actualShipDate'] - df['plannedShipDate']).dt.days,
        # Fix the lateStatement assignment by using lambda to reference the current dataframe
        lateStatement=lambda df: df['is_late'].apply(lambda x: "Darn Shipment is Late" if x else  "Shipment is on Time")
    )
)
```

### 2. Subset: Querying Rows and Filtering Columns

**Mental Model:** Query rows based on conditions and filter to keep specific columns.

Let's query for only late shipments and filter to keep the columns we need:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-2-subset
#| echo: true

# Query rows for late shipments and filter to keep specific columns
late_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .query('is_late == True')  # Query rows where is_late is True
    .filter(['shipID', 'partID', 'plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate', 'days_late'])  # Filter to keep specific columns
)

print(f"Found {len(late_shipments)} late shipments out of {len(shipments_with_lateness)} total")
print("\nLate shipments sample:")
print(late_shipments.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Understanding the Methods

- **`.query()`**: Query rows based on conditions (like SQL WHERE clause)
- **`.filter()`**: Filter to keep specific columns by name
- **Alternative**: You could use `.loc[]` for more complex row querying, but `.query()` is often more readable
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Subset Mental Model

**Question 1: Query vs Boolean Indexing**
- What's the difference between using `.query('is_late == True')` and `[df['is_late'] == True]`?
- Which approach is more readable and why?

**Question 2: Additional Row Querying**
- Can you show an example of using a variable like `late_threshold` to query rows for shipments that are at least `late_threshold` days late, e.g. what if you wanted to query rows for shipments that are at least 5 days late?
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

** Answer to Question 1: Query vs Boolean Indexing**
```{python}
# Using .query() - more readable, SQL-like syntax
late_shipments_query = shipments_with_lateness.query('is_late == True')

# Using boolean indexing - more Python-like
late_shipments_boolean = shipments_with_lateness[shipments_with_lateness['is_late'] == True]

# Both produce the same result, but:
# - .query() is more readable for simple conditions
# - .query() allows referencing column names directly as strings
# - Boolean indexing is more Python-like and flexible for complex conditions
# - Boolean indexing can be faster for very large datasets
```

** Answer to Question 2: Additional Row Querying**
```{python}
#| echo: true

# Define the threshold
late_threshold = 5

# REAL-WORLD APPLICATION: Dynamic threshold queries are essential for:
# - Customer service: Quickly identify customers who need proactive communication
# - Operations: Prioritize expedited shipping for critical late orders
# - Finance: Calculate penalty costs for SLA violations (e.g., 5% discount per day late)

# METHOD 1: Using .query() with @ to reference external variable
# WHY THIS MATTERS: Makes queries reusable and maintainable
# BUSINESS VALUE: Operations managers can adjust thresholds without touching complex code
# REAL-WORLD: Data analysts can create dashboard parameters that non-technical users can modify
very_late_query = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .query('days_late >= @late_threshold')  # @ symbol references variable from outer scope
    .filter(['shipID', 'partID', 'days_late'])  # Keep only relevant columns for reporting
    .sort_values('days_late', ascending=False)  # Worst offenders first for prioritization
)

print(f"Count: {len(very_late_query)}")
print(very_late_query.head(10))

print("\n" + "="*60)

# METHOD 2: Using boolean indexing (no @ needed)
# WHY THIS MATTERS: More Pythonic, integrates naturally with method chaining
# BUSINESS VALUE: Familiar to data scientists with Python backgrounds, can handle complex conditions
# REAL-WORLD: Better performance for very large datasets, can combine multiple conditions easily
very_late_brackets = (
    shipments_with_lateness[
        shipments_with_lateness['days_late'] >= late_threshold  # Direct boolean indexing
    ]
    [['shipID', 'partID', 'days_late']]  # Select specific columns

print("4. Real-world impact: Each late shipment may represent lost revenue and customer trust")
```

### 3. Drop: Removing Unwanted Data

**Mental Model:** Remove columns or rows you don't need.

Let's clean up our data by removing unnecessary columns:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-3-drop
#| echo: true

# Create a cleaner dataset by dropping unnecessary columns
clean_shipments = (
    shipments_with_lateness
    .drop(columns=['quantity'])  # Drop quantity column (not needed for our analysis)
    .dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])  # Remove rows with missing dates
)

print(f"Cleaned dataset: {len(clean_shipments)} rows, {len(clean_shipments.columns)} columns")
print("Remaining columns:", clean_shipments.columns.tolist())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Drop Mental Model

**Question 1: Drop vs Filter Strategies**
- What's the difference between `.drop(columns=['quantity'])` and `.filter()` with a list of columns you want to keep?
- When would you choose to drop columns vs filter to keep specific columns?

**Question 2: Handling Missing Data**
- What happens if you use `.dropna()` without specifying `subset`? How is this different from `.dropna(subset=['plannedShipDate', 'actualShipDate'])`?
- Why might you want to be selective about which columns to check for missing values?

    .drop(columns=['quantity'])  # We know we don't want quantity
)
print(".drop() - Remove unwanted columns")

```



### 4. Sort: Arranging Data

**Mental Model:** Order data by values or indices.

Let's sort by lateness to see the worst offenders:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-4-sort
#| echo: true

# Sort by days late (worst first)
sorted_by_lateness = (
    clean_shipments
    .sort_values('days_late', ascending=False)  # Sort by days_late, highest first
    .reset_index(drop=True)  # Reset index to be sequential
)

print("Shipments sorted by lateness (worst first):")
print(sorted_by_lateness[['shipID', 'partID', 'days_late', 'is_late']].head(10))
```

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Sort Mental Model

**Question 1: Sorting Strategies**
- What's the difference between `ascending=False` and `ascending=True` in sorting?
- How would you sort by multiple columns (e.g., first by `is_late`, then by `days_late`)?

**Question 2: Index Management**
- Why do we use `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting?
- What happens to the original index when you sort? Why might this be problematic?

**What happens to the original index when you sort? Why might this be problematic?**

When you sort a DataFrame, **the original index values remain attached to their rows**. This means:
- Row 0 in the sorted data might have been row 15 in the original data
- The index doesn't reflect the new position after sorting
- This creates confusion when accessing by position

**Why it's problematic:**
1. Position-based access fails (`.iloc[0]` isn't actually the first row after sorting)
2. Iterative operations break (loops don't work as expected)
3. Reports and dashboards show incorrect row numbers
4. Merges and joins can produce unexpected results

**Solution:** Always use `.reset_index(drop=True)` after sorting to renumber rows sequentially (0, 1, 2, 3...) and drop the old index.

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("\n⚠️ NOTICE: The index (0-19) doesn't match the new row order!")

### 5. Aggregate: Summarizing Data

**Mental Model:** Calculate summary statistics across groups or the entire dataset.

Let's calculate overall service level metrics:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-5-aggregate
#| echo: true

# Calculate overall service level metrics
service_metrics = (
    clean_shipments
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count total, count late, calculate percentage
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and maximum days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Overall Service Level Metrics:")
print(service_metrics)

# Calculate percentage on-time directly from the data
on_time_rate = (1 - clean_shipments['is_late'].mean()) * 100
print(f"\nOn-time delivery rate: {on_time_rate:.1f}%")
```

## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Aggregate Mental Model

**Question 1: Boolean Aggregation**
- Why does `sum()` work on boolean values? What does it count?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

** Answer to Question 1: Boolean Aggregation**

```{python}
#| echo: true

#   clean_shipments.agg({
#        'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean']
#   })

print(f"Total shipments: {clean_shipments['is_late'].sum()}")

print(f"Total late shipments: {clean_shipments.query('is_late == True').filter(['is_late']).count()}")
```
`sum()` works on boolean values because it counts the number of True values in the series. See above example using sum and query for late shipments's count. Both are same result.


### 6. Merge: Combining Information

**Mental Model:** Join data from multiple sources to create richer datasets.

Now let's analyze service levels by product category. First, we need to merge our data:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-6-merge-prep
#| echo: true

# Merge shipment data with product line data
shipments_with_category = (
    clean_shipments
    .merge(product_line_df, on='partID', how='left')  # Left join to keep all shipments
    .assign(
        category_late=lambda df: df['is_late'] & df['prodCategory'].notna()  # Only count as late if we have category info
    )
)

print("\nProduct categories available:")
print(shipments_with_category['prodCategory'].value_counts())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Merge Mental Model

**Question 1: Join Types and Data Loss**
- Why does your professor think we should use `how='left'` in most cases? 
- How can you check if any shipments were lost during the merge?

**Question 2: Key Column Matching**
- What happens if there are duplicate `partID` values in the `product_line_df`?

:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section

** Answer to Question 1: Join Types and Data Loss**

Using `how='left'` in most cases is because we want to keep all the data from the left dataframe and only add the data from the right dataframe if there is a match. If there is no match, the result will be `NaN`.
```{python}
# Compare different join types
print("Understanding Join Types:\n")

# Check sizes before merge
print(f"clean_shipments rows: {len(clean_shipments)}")
print(f"product_line_df rows: {len(product_line_df)}")
print()

# LEFT JOIN - Keep ALL shipments
left_join = clean_shipments.merge(product_line_df, on='partID', how='left')
print(f"LEFT JOIN:  {len(left_join)} rows (kept all shipments ✓)")

# INNER JOIN - Only matching rows
inner_join = clean_shipments.merge(product_line_df, on='partID', how='inner')
print(f"INNER JOIN: {len(inner_join)} rows (lost {len(clean_shipments) - len(inner_join)} shipments ✗)")
```

**Why LEFT JOIN is better than INNER JOIN?**
LEFT JOIN is better than INNER JOIN because it keeps all the data from the left dataframe and only adds the data from the right dataframe if there is a match. If there is no match, the result will be `NaN`.
```{python}
# Compare different join types
print("Understanding Join Types:\n")

# Check sizes before merge
print(f"clean_shipments rows: {len(clean_shipments)}")
print(f"product_line_df rows: {len(product_line_df)}")
print()
```

** Answer to Question 2: Key Column Matching**
```{python}
#| echo: true

# Check for duplicates in the product_line_df
print("Checking for duplicate partIDs in product_line_df:\n")
duplicate_count = product_line_df['partID'].duplicated().sum()
print(f"Duplicate partIDs: {duplicate_count}")

if duplicate_count > 0:
    print("\n⚠️  WARNING: Duplicates found!")
    print("This will create multiple rows for each shipment!")
    
    # Show an example
    dup_parts = product_line_df[product_line_df['partID'].duplicated(keep=False)].sort_values('partID')
    print("\nExample duplicates:")
    print(dup_parts.head(10))
else:
    print("✓ No duplicates - each partID is unique")
    print("This is good: 1-to-1 mapping between parts and categories")
```

**What happens with duplicates:**

If `product_line_df` has duplicate `partID` values, the merge will create **multiple rows** for each shipment:

```{python}
# Example:
#clean_shipments:         product_line_df:        Result after merge:
#shipID  partID          partID  category         shipID  partID  category
#10001   A123            A123    Electronics      10001   A123    Electronics
#                        A123    Accessories      10001   A123    Accessories  <- Duplicate!
```

**Result:** 1 shipment becomes 2 rows! This inflates your data and ruins aggregations.

**How to prevent:**
```{python}
# Remove duplicates before merge
product_line_clean = product_line_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['partID'])

# Or check first
assert product_line_df['partID'].is_unique, "Duplicates found!"
```

### 7. Split-Apply-Combine: Group Analysis

**Mental Model:** Group data and apply functions within each group.

Now let's analyze service levels by category:

```{python}
#| label: mental-model-7-groupby
#| echo: true

# Analyze service levels by product category
service_by_category = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('prodCategory')  # Split by product category
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['any', 'count', 'sum', 'mean'],  # Count, late count, percentage late
        'days_late': ['mean', 'max']  # Average and max days late
    })
    .round(3)
)

print("Service Level by Product Category:")
print(service_by_category)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🤔 Discussion Questions: Split-Apply-Combine Mental Model

**Question 1: GroupBy Mechanics**
- What does `.groupby('prodCategory')` actually do? How does it "split" the data?
- Why do we need to use `.agg()` after grouping? What happens if you don't?

**Question 2: Multi-Level Grouping**
- Explore grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']`?  What question does this answer versus grouping by `'prodCategory'` alone?  (HINT: There may be many rows with identical shipID's due to a particular order having multiple partID's.)
:::

#### Briefly Give Answers to the Discussion Questions In This Section


** Answer to Question 1: GroupBy Mechanics**
**What does `.groupby('prodCategory')` actually do? How does it "split" the data?**

`.groupby()` divides your DataFrame into separate groups based on unique values in the specified column(s). see below example.

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Let's see what groupby does step by step
print("Understanding GroupBy:\n")

# First, see what categories we have
print("Unique product categories:")
print(shipments_with_category['prodCategory'].value_counts())
print()

# When we groupby, it creates separate groups for each category
grouped = shipments_with_category.groupby('prodCategory')
print(f"Type of grouped object: {type(grouped)}")
print(f"Number of groups: {grouped.ngroups}")
print(f"Group names (keys): {list(grouped.groups.keys())}")
print()

# Look at one group
print("="*60)
print("Example: Looking at the 'Liquids' group")
liquids_group = grouped.get_group('Liquids')
print(f"Rows in Liquids group: {len(liquids_group)}")
print(liquids_group[['shipID', 'partID', 'prodCategory', 'is_late']].head())
```

**How it "splits" the data:**

1. **Identifies unique values** in the groupby column
2. **Separates rows** into groups based on those values
3. **Creates a GroupBy object** (not a DataFrame yet!)

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Visual demonstration of the split
print("\nVisual representation of how data is split:\n")

for category, group in grouped:
    print(f"{category}: {len(group)} rows")
    print(f"  Late shipments: {group['is_late'].sum()}")
    print(f"  On-time rate: {(1 - group['is_late'].mean()) * 100:.1f}%")
    print()
```

**Think of it like this:**
```
Original DataFrame:          After .groupby('prodCategory'):
shipID  prodCategory         
10001   Liquids              Group 1: Liquids
10002   Machines             ├─ All rows with 'Liquids'
10003   Liquids              
10004   Machines             Group 2: Machines
10005   Liquids              ├─ All rows with 'Machines'
                             
                             Group 3: Marketables
                             ├─ All rows with 'Marketables'
                             
                             Group 4: SpareParts
                             ├─ All rows with 'SpareParts'
```

**Why do we need to use `.agg()` after grouping? What happens if you don't?**

`.groupby()` alone just organizes the data - it doesn't calculate anything! You need `.agg()` to tell it WHAT to calculate for each group.

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("Understanding why we need .agg():\n")

# Step 1: Just groupby - creates a GroupBy object
just_grouped = shipments_with_category.groupby('prodCategory')
print(f"1. Just .groupby(): {type(just_grouped)}")
print("   This is NOT a DataFrame - it's a GroupBy object")
print("   You can't display it or use it directly!")
print()

# Step 2: Try to print it (won't show data)
print(f"2. Trying to use just_grouped directly:")
print(f"   {just_grouped}")
print("   See? Just shows it's a GroupBy object, not the data!")
print()

# Step 3: Use .agg() to get actual results
print(f"3. Using .agg() to calculate statistics:")
with_agg = just_grouped.agg({
    'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean']
})
print(with_agg)
print("\n   NOW we have a DataFrame with actual results!")
```

**What happens if you don't use `.agg()`?**

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("\nOptions after .groupby():\n")

grouped = shipments_with_category.groupby('prodCategory')

# Option 1: Use specific aggregation methods directly
print("Option 1: Direct aggregation methods")
print(grouped['is_late'].sum())  # Works! Shortcut for .agg('sum')
print()

# Option 2: Use .agg() for multiple calculations
print("Option 2: Use .agg() for complex aggregations")
result = grouped.agg({
    'is_late': ['count', 'sum', 'mean'],
    'days_late': ['mean', 'max']
})
print(result)
print()

# Option 3: Try to use grouped object without aggregation
print("Option 3: Try to print grouped object without aggregation")
try:
    print(grouped)  # Just shows the object type
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Key Insights:**

1. **`.groupby()` creates groups** but doesn't calculate anything
2. **`.agg()` tells pandas WHAT to calculate** for each group
3. **Without `.agg()`**, you have a GroupBy object (not usable data)
4. **With `.agg()`**, you get a DataFrame with results



**Common aggregation functions:**

.agg('sum')      # Total
.agg('mean')     # Average
.agg('count')    # Count rows
.agg('min')      # Minimum
.agg('max')      # Maximum
.agg(['sum', 'mean', 'count'])  # Multiple at once!


** Answer to Question 2: Key Column Matching**

**What does grouping by `['shipID', 'prodCategory']` do versus just `'prodCategory'`?**

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("Comparing single vs multi-level grouping:\n")

# Single-level: Group by prodCategory only
single_group = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('prodCategory')
    .agg({
        'is_late': ['count', 'sum']
    })
)
print("Single-level grouping by 'prodCategory':")
print(single_group)
print("\nQuestion answered: How many shipments per category are late?")
print()

print("="*60)

# Multi-level: Group by BOTH shipID and prodCategory
multi_group = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby(['shipID', 'prodCategory'])
    .agg({
        'is_late': 'any',  # True if ANY item late
        'partID': 'count'   # Count items in this shipment/category combo
    })
    .reset_index()
)
print("\nMulti-level grouping by ['shipID', 'prodCategory']:")
print(multi_group.head(15))
print("\nQuestion answered: For EACH shipment, what categories does it contain?")
```

**Key Difference:**

**Single-level `['prodCategory']`:**
- Groups ALL shipments by category
- Answer: "How do categories perform overall?"

**Multi-level `['shipID', 'prodCategory']`:**
- Groups by BOTH shipID AND category
- Creates one row per unique combination
- Answer: "Which categories are in each specific shipment?"

**Why is this useful?**
```{python}
#| echo: true

print("\nWhy multi-level grouping matters:\n")

# Use multi-level to find shipments with multiple categories
multi_category_info = (
    shipments_with_category
    .groupby('shipID')
    .agg({
        'prodCategory': 'nunique',  # Count unique categories
        'partID': 'count'           # Count total items
    })
    .reset_index()
)

# Find shipments with multiple categories
multi_cat = multi_category_info[multi_category_info['prodCategory'] > 1]
print(f"Shipments with multiple categories: {len(multi_cat)}")
print(f"Percentage: {len(multi_cat) / len(multi_category_info) * 100:.1f}%")
print("\nExamples:")
print(multi_cat.head(10))
```

**Business Insight:**
- Single-level: Category performance
- Multi-level: Cross-category shopping behavior!


## Answering A Business Question

**Mental Model:** Combine multiple data manipulation techniques to answer complex business questions.

Let's create a comprehensive analysis by combining shipment-level data with category information:

        'days_late': 'max'  # Maximum days late for this shipment/category
    })
    .reset_index()
    .assign(
        has_multiple_categories=lambda df: df.groupby('shipID')['prodCategory'].transform('nunique') > 1
    )
)

print("Comprehensive analysis - shipments with multiple categories:")

**What insights can ZappTech's management gain from knowing the percentage of multi-category shipments?**

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("\nBusiness Insights from Multi-Category Analysis:\n")

# Calculate key metrics
total_unique_shipments = comprehensive_analysis['shipID'].nunique()
multi_category_shipments = comprehensive_analysis[comprehensive_analysis['has_multiple_categories']]['shipID'].nunique()
percentage = multi_category_shipments / total_unique_shipments * 100

print(f"📈 Key Metric: {percentage:.1f}% of shipments contain multiple categories")
print()

# Compare service levels
multi_cat_late = comprehensive_analysis[
    comprehensive_analysis['has_multiple_categories']
]['is_late'].mean()

single_cat_late = comprehensive_analysis[
    ~comprehensive_analysis['has_multiple_categories']
]['is_late'].mean()

print("Service Level Comparison:")
print(f"  Multi-category orders late rate: {multi_cat_late * 100:.1f}%")
print(f"  Single-category orders late rate: {single_cat_late * 100:.1f}%")
print()

# Calculate revenue impact (assuming multi-category = higher value)
print("="*60)
print("MANAGEMENT INSIGHTS:")
print("="*60)
```

**1. Cross-Selling Opportunity:**
- 23.3% of customers buy from multiple categories
- Opportunity to increase cross-selling to the other 76.7%
- Product bundling strategies could boost average order value

**2. Customer Segmentation:**
- Multi-category buyers are more valuable customers
- Different marketing/retention strategies needed
- Target cross-category promotions to single-category buyers

**3. Warehouse & Logistics Planning:**
- 23% of orders require picking from multiple zones
- May need different fulfillment strategies
- Cross-category orders might have different complexity

**4. Inventory Management:**
- Need to stock complementary products together
- Understand which categories are bought together
- Optimize warehouse layout for common combinations

**5. Service Level Strategy:**
- Compare late rates: Multi-category vs single-category
- May need different SLAs for complex orders
- Resource allocation based on order complexity

**6. Marketing Strategy:**
```{python}
# If 23% buy multi-category naturally:
# - Promote bundles to increase this to 30-35%
# - Study what triggers cross-category purchases
# - Create "Complete the Set" campaigns
```

**7. Revenue Implications:**
```{python}
# Assumptions:
# - Single-category order avg: $100
# - Multi-category order avg: $250 (2.5x)

single_cat_revenue = (total_unique_shipments * 0.767) * 100
multi_cat_revenue = (total_unique_shipments * 0.233) * 250
total_revenue = single_cat_revenue + multi_cat_revenue

# If we increase multi-category from 23% to 30%:
# Additional revenue = 7% of customers × $150 extra = significant!
```

### Getting Started Tips

::: {.callout-note}
## 🎯 Method Chaining Philosophy

> "Each operation should build naturally on the previous one"

*Think of method chaining like building with LEGO blocks - each piece connects to the next, creating something more complex and useful than the individual pieces.*
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
